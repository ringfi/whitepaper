### **How can I join the Pre-Launch on PinkSale?**

Pre-Launch is scheduled to happen on March 10th at 12:00pm UTC on PinkSale, where everyone will have the opportunity to buy $RING tokens at the same price. \
To buy you need to connect your Metamask of Trustwallet to the Dapp of PinkSale. Then you will need to have BNB in your Metamask. The only way to pay in PinkSale is having BNB. It will be on a first come first serve. It means that most probably it will be sold out in the first minutes.

### **Is there a Whitelist?**

No, there is no Whitelist and no way to have priority on the buying process. The team firmly believe that&#x20;

### **Will I start receiving my APY interest yield immediately on Day 1 after I purchase at Pre-Launch?**

Yes, unless the Hardcap is not reached the first day. In this unlikely case you would start to get the interest 24 hours after Hardcap is reached.

### **Is RingFi just another Titano Fork?**

We have deployed mechanisms in place that offer many improvements over our competition such as; our Auto-Liquidity System, the Risk-Free Value allocation, the Automated Supply Control and all the other features that support circular economy principles. Also notice that our fees are hard-coded and cannot be updated, which leave our users with the peace of mind that the fees will not be raised after the purchase.

### **How can you sustain such a huge APY?**

The RingFi protocol has an entirely different, more comprehensive mechanism than Titano/Libero/Safuu or other competitors. $RING token has an Automated Supply Control that burns 2.5% of every transaction, auto LP every 24 hours, and the factor of rebasing at 15min intervals provides a more linear progression of sustainability. The market volume will enter revenue into the Treasury as a 2.5-4.5% tax and enter an additional 5% into the Risk-Free Value Fund, which more than offsets the daily interest being awarded. APY will be 100% sustained. RingFi is a Systematic and Experimental Approach to the Circular Economy and Sustainability in DeFi. The next generation of 3.0 protocols

### Refresh Balance Button

The rebase triggers every 15 minutes, but the protocol needs a wallet to wallet transaction to refresh the balances on the wallets. This button sends 0.001 ring from the "refreshBalance" contract to the treasury every time it's called and helps the protocol to work fully onchain and smoothly.

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't have to "claim" or "refresh" your balance, the autocompoundig works on every case. Only use this function if you want to help the portocol and update everyones wallet balance.&#x20;
