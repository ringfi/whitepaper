# ðŸ‘‹ RingFi Introduction

## What is RingFi?

RingFi follows the steps of Titano and Libero but takes it one step further by releasing wRING, a composable (Yield-farming compatible) version of RING that enables users to collect yields on BSC dapps while still receiving rebases.

RIngFi protocol proudly deployed the world's first composable auto-staking token, which allow users to maximize profits, becoming the **next generation DeFi** release on the BSC, conceived to earn passive returns in the easiest and most sustainable way.&#x20;

The token model behind is an experimental approach to ''The circular economy'' concept, consisting of an Auto-staking feature just by holding the token plus a fixed APY that is sustainable over time and backed by a reserve of funds.

$RING token is powered by rebases, that reward holders with a 0.02362% every 15min. This means an annual compound interest of 392,537%. This APY is fixed and it is secured thanks to the 14% and 16% taxes with buys and sells respectively.&#x20;

Other protocols allow bonds that passively dilute your position and pass it on to bondholders (thereby reducing your market share). Thanks to the tax system, RingFi gets its income from taxes, not bonds, and when someone buys or sells, investors benefit. There is no passive dilution to mint new tokens through binding.

The goal for RingFi is simple, to build a Crypto Reserve Currency that will still exist in the years to come and become the base for a future **ecosystem** that offers a range of crypto products and services, all built from a strong foundation of consistent high APY rewards.

The tokenomics and features of $RING are meant to ensure the **project's sustainability** in perpetuity. The rewards received by $RING holders come from a fee charged to every user each time $RING is transacted, either through a buy or sell. This amount is accrued to a special wallet and designed to support the rebase rewards in $RING going forward algorithmically.

The competitive advantages of RingFi are its unique mechanics like auto-liquidity every 24h and the composability, thanks to the wRING, that allow users to yield farm and use it as collateral while still receiving rebases.

About security standards, there are 3 **audit reports** ([RING](https://github.com/coinscope-co/audits/blob/main/ring/audit.pdf), [wRING](https://github.com/coinscope-co/audits/blob/main/wring/audit.pdf) and [RFN NFTs](features/rfn-risk-free-notes-nfts.md)) performed by CyberScope, the team has KYC'd to pinksale and locked liquidity 100 years.&#x20;
