### Simplicity

Staking, sTOKENS, wsTOKENS, Claiming and compounding...This is a complicated, expensive and time-consuming process. The good news are that this process is inexistent when you buy $RING.\
Once you hold $RING in your wallet you donâ€™t have to deal with our website, you are automatically receiving rebase benefits. The most user-friendly auto-staking system in DeFi.

### Sustainability

We stray away from degen APYs to keep our treasury healthy while still offering competitive returns. How do we try to issue this many tokens without their price crashing into the endless abyss that is 0? Simple. We have introduced a taxation principle. The tax fees are split and used for different actions within the protocol.

### Taxation

Other protocols allow bonds that passively dilute your position and pass it on to bondholders (thereby reducing your market share). Thanks to our tax system, we get our income from taxes, not bonds, and when someone buys or sells, you as an investor benefit.

### Power

Because APYs fluctuate in different protocols, itâ€™s impossible to predict how many tokens youâ€™ll receive during a given time frame. RingFi pays $RING holders a daily fixed rate of 0.02362% every 15min, which means an annual compound interest of 392,537%.\
