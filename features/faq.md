### Refresh Balance Button

The rebase triggers every 15 minutes, but the protocol needs a wallet to wallet transaction to refresh the balances on the wallets. This button sends 0.001 ring from the "refreshBalance" contract to the treasury every time it's called and helps the protocol to work fully onchain and smoothly.

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't have to "claim" or "refresh" your balance, the autocompoundig works on every case. Only use this function if you want to help the portocol and update everyones wallet balance.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
