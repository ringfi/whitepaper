RingFi has integrated a comprehensive RFV structure which takes advantage of the trading volume fees in order to back the staking rewards (rebase rewards).

{% hint style="info" %}
When the daily **RFV gains are greater** than or equal to all the Holders Daily ROI, this mean that the Swap Threshold can fill the plus-value generated from the Rebase Rewards
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If the daily **RFV gains are lower** than the Holders Daily ROI, a portion of the Treasury is added to fill the difference.
{% endhint %}
