# ðŸ’° Treasury

The Treasury plays a very important role in RingFi. It provides four extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of the protocol.

1. The treasury functions as additional financial support for the RFV. This additional support can become important in the event of an extreme price drop of the token. It helps to create a floor value for the token.
2. Fund new products within our system, and acquire new projects and assets to the protocol/ecosystem, along with providing capital for internal expenditure, like Marketing and Development.
