# ðŸ›¡ Risk-Free Value

**RFV** is the acronym for Risk-Free Value which is a separate wallet in RingFi's system.&#x20;

The RFV uses an algorithm that backs the Rebase Rewards and is supported by a portion of the buy and sell trading fees that accrue in the RFV wallet. In simple terms, the staking rewards (rebase rewards) which are distributed every 15 minutes are backed by the RFV parameter, thus ensuring a high and stable interest rate to token holders.
