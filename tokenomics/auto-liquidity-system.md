# ⚖ Auto-Liquidity System

Every 24 hours our Auto-Liquidity System (ALS) will inject automatic liquidity into the market.&#x20;

On each buy or sell order there is a 4% tax fee that automatically gets stored into an Auto-LP wallet and built into our protocol’s smart contract is the mechanism that smartly takes 50% of the amount of $RING stored in the wallet, and will automatically buy BNB at the current market price.

The remaining 50% of $RING in the Auto-LP wallet will be used for the $RING side of liquidity, therefore giving equal an 50/50 weighting of $RING/BNB which will then be automatically added as new, additional liquidity into the market pair and raising the amount of liquidity in the pool.
