# ðŸ§¾ Taxation

Other protocols allow bonds that passively dilute your position and pass it on to bondholders (thereby reducing your market share). Thanks to our tax system, we get our income from taxes, not bonds, and when someone buys or sells, you as an investor benefit. There is no passive dilution to mint new tokens through binding.&#x20;
